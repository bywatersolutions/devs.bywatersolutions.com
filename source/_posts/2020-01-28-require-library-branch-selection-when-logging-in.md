title: Require Library Branch Selection when Logging in
module: Authentication
short_description: Require branch when logging in
rt: 63834

Do you have staff that move between locations regularly and occassionally (or frequently) log into the wrong location?  This can impact circulation rules, transit items, etc when those staff members are working.  This proposed development would require staff to choose their library when logging in.

This functionality would be a system preference where a library system can enable or disable the forced library selection. If enabled, users on the staff side would see a blank in the top line of the library dropdown and be forced to select a library from the list.  Users who do not select a branch are returned to the login screen as Koha would not allow the default branch to be used as a fallback. 

This development is quoted at $2000.
