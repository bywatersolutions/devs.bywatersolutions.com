title: Self Check Circulation Display

Patrons with high number of checkouts currently need to wait between each checkout as the module displays the entire list of checkouts before allowing the next checkout. We are proposing enhancing the display of a patron's checkouts using an Ajax table. This would appear very similar to the table on the circulation screen in the staff side.  To speed up checkouts for patrons with high numbers of checkouts, there would be a button they can click to see all the checkouts if desired.
