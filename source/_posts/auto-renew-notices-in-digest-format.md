## A New Post

Add digest notices for the auto renewal notices. 

This would be based on this current community request: https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=18532 to create the auto renewal notices as a patron messaging preference. These could be sent individually, or as a digest email.
