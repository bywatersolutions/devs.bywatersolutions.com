When checking out books from the staff client, newly checked out books are automatically separated from books that are currently checked out to the patron. The self-check should also have a way of distinguishing newly checked out books from previously checked out books.

# Work to be done
1. Identify new checkouts and renewals
2. Pass this data to the template
3. Have template apply a special class to those checkouts
4. Apply CSS to style these checkouts
