## Enhancement to the Patron Expiration Notices

Part 1
 - Add a new messaging preference for patron expiration notices
 - This would allow patrons to choose how they receive the message (email,sms,phone, as the library offers)
 - Adjust the existing patron_expiry cronjob to check patron messaging preferences and create the correct type of notice
 
Part 2
 - Add a system preference to enforce selecting one messaging preference as mandatory
 - Above work in part 1 would allow patrons to also choose to receive no message, Part 2 would be a follow-up to enforce selection of at least 1 type for libraries who do not wish to allow patrons to opt out


Cost: $3000
