short_description: Alter the behavior of iCal Exporting of Due dates
---


Alter the behavior of the iCal download.  Currently duedates download showing the exact date and time the item is due, most often 23:59pm on the date due (2019-07-08 23:59).  This creates a calendar entry at that exact time.  Change the calendar entries to be "All day events" on the day the item is due.
