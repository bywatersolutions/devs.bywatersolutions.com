## Syndetics setup on staff client
	
Syndetics content is not currently available on the staff client.  
In order to facilitate the display of Syndetics data on the staff side we propose to
1. Create REST API to interact with Syyndetics module.  
2. Use the API to pull Syndetics informatino and display it on the staff side  

Part 2 of this development will involve incorporating the API and code changes onto the OPAC in order to improve performance.

This is a 2 part development.  Phase 1 is quoted at $4000 and Phase 2 is quoted at $2000
