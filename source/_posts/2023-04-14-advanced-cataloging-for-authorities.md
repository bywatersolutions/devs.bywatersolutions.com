Advanced Cataloging for Authorities

Do you enjoy cataloging Authority records?  Do you want an option that allows you to run enter tags, subfields and content in authority records without using a 'basic editor'?  If you love the Advanced Cataloging option in bibliographic records and want to see this option available for Authorities, this enhancement is for you!

Proposal:
Create interface to allow catalogers to use an Advanced Cataloging option in Authorities.  This will be based on the interface currently available in Bibliographic cataloging.
