Currently, when an item gets marked lost from the ‘Items’ tab but isn’t checked for holds, the hold gets abandoned. If the ‘Holds’ tab displayed a persistent count of holds despite which page you’re viewing, that would help catch some of these orphaned holds.

# Work to be done
Add the number of holds to the holds tab.
