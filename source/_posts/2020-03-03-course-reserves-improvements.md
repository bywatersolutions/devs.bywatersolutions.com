title: Course Reserves Improvements
RT: 60879
module: Course Reserves
short_description: Speed improvements in Course Reserves
---
This development is designed to improve the functionality/efficiency/speed in the Course Reserves module.  We are proposing to create an API (or a few) in the course reserves module to facilitate the manipulation and display of data.  This should have the primary benefit of making the course reserves module faster when using.  It will also allow for new features/enhancements to be built due to the new API(s) written.

Cost of $6000
