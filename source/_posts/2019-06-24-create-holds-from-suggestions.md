Do your patrons place suggestions?  Do you order from those suggestions?  Would your patrons like to be automatically placed into the holds queue for that title you ordered that they suggested?

**If so, this is the development for you and your patrons!**

This development project will have Koha automatically place a hold for a patron when the acquisitions department places an order from the Patron's Suggestion.  Also, when the ability to link orders to a suggestion in included in Koha, this development would create holds for those patrons.
