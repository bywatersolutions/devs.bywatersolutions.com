**Add the ability Cancel Multiple Holds**

When holds expire, canceling holds one at a time, takes a lot of time.  With this development we would like to add the ability to select multiple holds and cancel them at once.

In the Holds Awaiting Pickup module, on the "Holds Waiting Over.." tab, we would like to add checkboxes to the holds listed.  And then add a button to allow staff to Cancel just those holds they have selected.
