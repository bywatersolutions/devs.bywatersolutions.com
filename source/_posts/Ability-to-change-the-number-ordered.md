Adds the ability to enter a number for additional copies of items instead of hitting “add” repeatably in a basket.  This development will add a new form to the page where you will be able to specify how many copies of the item to be added.

# Work to be done
* Add new “Add X items” form to the page
* Add javascript that will trigger the creation of the given number of items automatically.
