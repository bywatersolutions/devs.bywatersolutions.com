When importing records using the record import tool, it would be nice to be able to match on ISSN.  This development will be similar to the ISBN matching (http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=10500) that was done previously but change to match on ISSN.

# Work to be done
* Duplicate the development for aggressive matching on ISBN, but change it to be ISSN instead.
