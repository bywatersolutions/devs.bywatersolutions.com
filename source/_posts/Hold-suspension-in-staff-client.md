Currently, patrons are able to suspend individual holds in the OPAC; however staff can only cancel holds for the patrons from within the staff client. This development would give staff the same functionality as patrons in order to assist them.

# Work to be done
* For both “Check out” and “Details” pages, add the ability to suspend
* Base this on the improvements to the OPAC suspension found in Bug 11694
* This will be dependent on Bug 11703
