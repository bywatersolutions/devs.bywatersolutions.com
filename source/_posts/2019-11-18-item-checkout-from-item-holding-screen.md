Do you walk a patron to the stacks to find a book they need?  Do you also have a tablet or portable device with you?  Would you like to check that item out to the patron right there?

If so, this development is for you.  We propose adding functionality to the details screen to allow staff to checkout an item to a patron right there!  See the image for a suggested interface.
