Add the ability to print a slip when an item comes in and is received.  The slip would contain basic information about the item such as title, author and ISBN (to be able to match the item to the correct slip).  Additionally, the slip would contain other information such as number of holds, branch for multi-branch systems, nonpublic note (example: you indicate things like NYTimes Best Seller in item nonpublic note), and the receipt date.
